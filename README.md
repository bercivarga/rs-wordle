# [W][O][R][D][L][E] &mdash; Rust-based Wordle game, in your terminal!

Ever heard of the world-wide phenomenon, [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) from the good folks at The New York Times? If not, here's a short rundown on what the game is:

In Wordle, your goal is to guess a random 5-letter word in 6 tries. With each guess, you reveal more information about the word by getting feedback on the characters you entered: When a character is not in the word, it's marked with a red color, if it is in the word but in the wrong place, then it's marked with a yellow color, and if the word is in the word and in the correct place, then it's drawn in green. The secret word changes every day.

This application takes the original Wordle concept and puts it right in your terminal.
